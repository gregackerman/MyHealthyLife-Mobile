# MyHealthyLife-Mobile

This repo stores the mobile/web frontend for the MyHealthyLife Bluemix demo.

The demo will show how to use mobile/web, push, node API, Cloudant, and Weather on Bluemix to send healthy notifications to patients and track the uptake and effectiveness of the notifications over time.
